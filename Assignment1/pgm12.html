    <h1>Long Quote</h1>
    <h3>“Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful. Success is not measured by what you accomplish, but by the obstacles you overcome, the lessons you learn, and the impact you have on the world around you. The real measure of success is not just achieving your goals, but how you have enriched the lives of others along the way.”</h3>
    <h3 style="text-align: right;">― Albert Schweitzer</h3>
